**Thalison Silva** ‍| **Software Developer** 

**About Me**

As a developer, my focus is on creating innovative and scalable solutions. With a specialization in technologies such as Kotlin, JavaScript and React Native, I lead projects with advanced methodologies and cutting-edge technologies, ensuring their maintenance and evolution. The Catholic University of Brasília is shaping my vision of software engineering, where I am currently studying for a postgraduate degree, scheduled to be completed in March 2025.

My portfolio reflects my technical competence and ability to develop efficient software architectures. Working with technologies such as Golang and Angular, in addition to my experience, reinforces my ability to actively contribute to the success of implementations and system administration. I strive to collaborate for business growth and efficiency through robust technological solutions.
